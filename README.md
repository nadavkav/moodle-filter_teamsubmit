moodle-filter_teamsubmit
===================

Moodle filter which embed Team submission management UI into an assignment intro.
(Based on the Team_submit block early experiment) to enable a "Group" like feature 
in the assignment module, but without using Moodle core course group framework, 
as those "Teams" are ephemeral, which change form assignment to assignment on the same course. 


Requirements

This plugin requires Moodle 3.1+


Changes

* 2016-11-12 - Initial functionality, based on block_teamsubmit

Installation

Usage
-----

First, activate the filter_teamsubmit plugin in Site Administration -> Plugins -> Filters -> Manage filters

Create a new assignment or go into an existing one. At the intro setting, use the following syntax:
[[teamsubmit,5]] 

In which 5 is the limit of team members, including the leader which submit the assignment in everyone's 
name and also get graded, which is copied to all other members. 

If you are using the filter Geberico spacial button to initiate and innsert the this filter's shortcode,
you should get the Generico preset from the main folder of this repository (filter/teamsubmit/generico-preset-team_submit.txt), and install it into your system too.

Moodle release support
----------------------

Due to limited resources, filter_teamsubmit is only maintained for the most recent major release of Moodle. However, previous versions of this plugin which work in legacy major releases of Moodle are still available as-is without any further updates in the Moodle Plugins repository.

There may be several weeks after a new major release of Moodle has been published until we can do a compatibility check and fix problems if necessary. If you encounter problems with a new major release of Moodle - or can confirm that filter_teamsubmit still works with a new major relase.


Right-to-left support
---------------------

This plugin leverages Moodle's support for right-to-left (RTL) languages. This support was added as a contribution by nadavkav.
However, we don't regularly test it with a RTL language. If you have problems with the plugin and a RTL language, you are free to send me a pull request on
github with modifications.
